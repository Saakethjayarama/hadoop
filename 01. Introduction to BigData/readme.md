## Need for big data analytics

- Make smarter and more efficient organizations
- Optimize Business operations by analysing customer behaviour
- Cost reduction
- Next generation products

## What is Big data analytics?

- BDA examines large and different types of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlation and other insights.

## Stages in BDA

1. Identifying problem
2. Designing data requirment
3. Pre-Processing Data
4. Performing Analytics over data
5. Visualizing data

## Types of Big Data Analysis

1. Descriptive Analysis :- Get new data based on past data detect what is happening. (Google analytics)
2. Predictive Analysis :- Uses statistical analysis to understand what could happen in future.
3. Prescriptive Analysis :- Optimization and simulation algorithms to decide. (Self driving cars)
4. Diagnostic Analytics :- Based on the impression certain events predict whether future events causes success or failure

## Bottlenecks

- Restaurant Problem and Traditional Processing
- Distributed and Parallel approach
- (Multiple food shelves, cooks and main cook) and (Data locality, Map, Reduce)
- This soln can be scaled up or down based on requirements in restaurant similarly can be solved using Apache's Hadoop framework to process Big Data.
